;   Title:              Subroutines
;
;   Hardware:           STK600, CPU ATmega2560
;
;   Function:           Counts number of times switch SW0 changes values, i.e.
;                       how many times the switch goes from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.
;
;                       The counter is outputted to the LEDs in binary form
;                       each time the counter gets incremented.
;
;   Input ports:        PIN0 on PORTC
;
;   Output ports:       PORTB
;
;   Subroutines:        wait_for_switch_press   - Delays execution of the 
;                                                 Program until SW0 is press
;                       on_switch_down          -
;                       wait_for_switch_release -
;                       on_switch_up            -
;                       led_out                 -
;                       delay_switch            -

;   Other information:  N/A
;
;   Changes in program: 
;                       2017-09-14:
;                       Implements flowchart design.
;
;                       2017-09-19:
;                       Refactors the code by breaking smaller subroutines into
;                       multiple smaller ones. Adds comments
