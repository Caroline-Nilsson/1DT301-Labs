The final assignment was to write a program that displays a \emph{Johnson counter} to the LEDs in an infinite loop. A Johnson counter is a counter that sets all bits in a bit string one-by-one and, when all bits are set, clears the bits one-by-one. Of course, this program will also need a delay after each value in the Johnson counter has been written to the LEDs. Otherwise the program would run so fast that all LEDs would most likely appear to be lit all the time.
