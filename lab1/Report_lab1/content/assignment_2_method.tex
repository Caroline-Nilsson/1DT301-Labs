We figured the simplest way to solve this problem was to redirect the input from the switches to the LEDs repeateadly in a loop. We start by setting \texttt{PORTB} as output and \texttt{PORTC} as input. Then, in an infinite loop, we read the value of the pins on \texttt{PORTC} to a register and output the value of that register to \texttt{PORTB}.
