;
;   Lab number:         1
;   Title:              How to use the PORTs. Digital input /output.
;                       Subroutine call.
;
;   Hardware:           STK600, CPU ATmega2560
;
;   Function:           Turns on LED0 when SW5 is held down.
;
;   Input ports:        PORTD
;
;   Output ports:       PORTB
;
;   Subroutines:        N/A
;   Included files:     m2560def.inc
;
;   Other information:  As with assignment 2, we have to keep in mind that
;                       a pressed switch is registered as a 0.
;
;   Changes in program: 
;                       2017-09-01:
;                       Implemented flowchart design.
;
;                       2017-09-04:
;                       Minor refactoring. Adds header and comments.
