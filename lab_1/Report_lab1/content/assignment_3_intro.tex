In the third assignment we were to write an Assembly program that turns on \texttt{LED0} when the switch \texttt{SW5} is pressed. Nothing should happen when the other switches are pressed. We assumed that the way the program should work is that the LED would stay lit for as long as \texttt{SW5} was pressed down and turn off when the switch was released.
