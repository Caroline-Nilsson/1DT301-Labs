In the second assignment we were to write a program that waits for a switch
to be pressed and then lights up the corresponding LED. For example if switch 3
is pressed LED 3 should light up. The way we interpreted the assignment was
that the LED should stay on for as long as the switch is pressed and turn off
when the switch is released.

We figured the easiest way to do this was to simply redirect the input from the
switches to the LEDs. Since both the input from the switches and the output to
the LEDs are bit strings were each bit corresponds to a switch/LED
