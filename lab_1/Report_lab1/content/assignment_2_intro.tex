In the second assignment we were to write a program that waits for a switch to be pressed and then lights up the corresponding LED. For example if switch 3 is pressed LED 3 should light up. The way we interpreted the assignment was that the LED should stay on for as long as the switch is pressed down and turn off when the switch is released.
