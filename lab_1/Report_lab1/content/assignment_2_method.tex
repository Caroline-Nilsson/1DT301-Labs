We figured the simplest way to solve this problem was to simply redirect the input from the switches to the LEDs repeateadly in a loop. Initially we thought that we hade to take the complement of the input since we assumed that the switches used a pull-up resistor and the LEDs did not. For example if \texttt{SW5} was pressed, the input would be ${1101\ 1111}_2$ but the output would need to be ${0010\ 0000}_2$ to light up \texttt{LED5}. When the program was tested on hardware we noticed that this was not the case and as such there was no need to take the complement of the input.
