In the process of working with the laboratory assignments we started by doing research about the assembly language and the STK600 in order to better understand how to solve the different assignments. 
In each assignment we first created a pseudocode solution which we converted to flowchart diagrams, then it was rather simple to convert this into assembly language. Common for all assignments is also that we have been using the simulations to confirm that the program is working and completing the correct tasks.
