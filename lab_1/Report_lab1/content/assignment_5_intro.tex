The fifth assignment was to write an Assembly program that outputs a ring counter to the LEDs. Between each value in the counter, there should be a delay of approximately $0.5$ seconds. Since the delay should be a subroutine in the program, the stack pointer \texttt{SP} needs to be initialized as instructed in the description of the assignment.
